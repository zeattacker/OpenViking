# OpenClaw + OpenViking Context-Engine Plugin

Use [OpenViking](https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking) as the long-term memory backend for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). In OpenClaw, this plugin is registered as the `openviking` context engine.

This document is not an installation guide. It is an implementation-focused design note for integrators and engineers. It describes how the plugin works today based on the code under `examples/openclaw-plugin`, not a future refactor target.

## Documentation

- Install and upgrade: [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)
- Chinese design and install guide: [INSTALL-ZH.md](./INSTALL-ZH.md)
- Agent-oriented operator guide: [INSTALL-AGENT.md](./INSTALL-AGENT.md)

## Design Positioning

- OpenClaw still owns the agent runtime, prompt orchestration, and tool execution.
- OpenViking owns long-term memory retrieval, session archiving, archive summaries, and memory extraction.
- `examples/openclaw-plugin` is not a narrow “memory lookup” plugin. It is an integration layer that spans the OpenClaw lifecycle.

In the current implementation, the plugin plays four roles at once:

- `context-engine`: implements `assemble`, `afterTurn`, and `compact`
- hook layer: handles `before_prompt_build`, `session_start`, `session_end`, `agent_end`, and `before_reset`
- tool provider: registers `memory_recall`, `memory_store`, `memory_forget`, and `ov_archive_expand`
- runtime manager: starts and monitors an OpenViking subprocess in `local` mode

## Overall Architecture

![Overall OpenClaw and OpenViking plugin architecture](./images/openclaw-plugin-engine-overview.png)

The diagram above reflects the current implementation boundary:

- OpenClaw remains the primary runtime on the left. The plugin does not take over agent execution.
- The middle layer combines hooks, the context engine, tools, and runtime management in one plugin registration.
- All HTTP traffic goes through `OpenVikingClient`, which centralizes `X-OpenViking-*` headers and routing logs.
- The OpenViking service owns sessions, memories, archives, and Phase 2 extraction, with storage under `viking://user/*`, `viking://agent/*`, and `viking://session/*`.

That split lets OpenClaw stay focused on reasoning and orchestration while OpenViking becomes the source of truth for long-lived context.

## Identity and Routing

The plugin does not send one fixed agent ID to OpenViking. It tries to keep OpenClaw session identity and OpenViking routing aligned.

The main rules are:

- reuse `sessionId` directly when it is already a UUID
- prefer `sessionKey` when deriving a stable `ovSessionId`
- normalize unsafe path characters, or fall back to a stable SHA-256 when needed
- resolve `X-OpenViking-Agent` per session, not per process
- when `plugins.entries.openviking.config.agentId` is not `default`, prefix the session agent as `<configAgentId>_<sessionAgent>`
- add `X-OpenViking-Account`, `X-OpenViking-User`, and `X-OpenViking-Agent` in the client layer

This matters because the plugin is built to support multi-agent and multi-session OpenClaw usage without mixing memories across sessions.

## Prompt-Front Recall Flow

![Automatic recall flow before prompt build](./images/openclaw-plugin-recall-flow.png)

Today the main recall path still lives in `before_prompt_build`:

1. Extract the latest user text from `messages` or `prompt`.
2. Resolve the agent routing for the current `sessionId/sessionKey`.
3. Run a quick availability precheck so prompt building does not stall when OpenViking is unavailable.
4. Query both `viking://user/memories` and `viking://agent/memories` in parallel.
5. Deduplicate, threshold-filter, rerank, and trim the results under a token budget.
6. Prepend the selected memories as a `<relevant-memories>` block.

The reranking logic is not pure vector-score sorting. The current implementation also considers:

- whether a result is a leaf memory with `level == 2`
- whether it looks like a preference memory
- whether it looks like an event memory
- lexical overlap with the current query

### Transcript ingest assist

This path also includes a special transcript-oriented branch.

When the latest user input looks like pasted multi-speaker transcript content:

- metadata blocks, command text, and pure question text are filtered out
- the cleaned text is checked against speaker-turn and length thresholds
- if it matches, the plugin prepends a lightweight `<ingest-reply-assist>` instruction

The goal is not to change memory logic. It is to reduce the chance that the model responds with `NO_REPLY` when the user pastes chat history, meeting notes, or conversation transcripts for ingestion.

## Session Lifecycle

![Session lifecycle and compaction boundary](./images/openclaw-plugin-session-lifecycle.png)

Session handling is the main axis of this design. In the current implementation it covers history assembly, incremental append, asynchronous commit, and blocking compaction readback.

### What `assemble()` does

`assemble()` is not just replaying old chat history. It reads session context back from OpenViking under a token budget, then rebuilds OpenClaw-facing messages:

- `latest_archive_overview` becomes `[Session History Summary]`
- `pre_archive_abstracts` becomes `[Archive Index]`
- active session messages stay in message-block form
- assistant tool parts become `toolUse`
- tool output becomes separate `toolResult`
- the final message list goes through a tool-use/result pairing repair pass

That means OpenClaw sees “compressed history summary + archive index + active messages”, not an ever-growing raw transcript.

### What `afterTurn()` does

`afterTurn()` has a narrower job: append only the new turn into the OpenViking session.

- it slices only the newly added messages
- it keeps only `user` / `assistant` capture text
- it preserves `toolUse` / `toolResult` content in the serialized turn text
- it strips injected `<relevant-memories>` blocks and metadata noise before capture
- it appends the sanitized turn text into the OpenViking session

After that, the plugin checks `pending_tokens`. Once the session crosses `commitTokenThreshold`, it triggers `commit(wait=false)`:

- archive generation and Phase 2 memory extraction continue asynchronously on the server
- the current turn is not blocked waiting for extraction
- if `logFindRequests` is enabled, the logs include the task id and follow-up extraction detail

### What `compact()` does

`compact()` is the stricter synchronous boundary:

- it calls `commit(wait=true)` and blocks for completion
- when an archive exists, it re-reads `latest_archive_overview`
- it returns updated token estimates, the latest archive id, and summary content
- if the summary is too coarse, the model can call `ov_archive_expand` to reopen a specific archive

So `afterTurn()` is closer to “incremental append plus threshold-triggered async commit”, while `compact()` is the explicit “wait for archive and compaction to finish” boundary.

## Tools and Expandability

Beyond automatic behavior, the plugin exposes four tools directly:

- `memory_recall`: explicit long-term memory search
- `memory_store`: write text into an OpenViking session and trigger commit
- `memory_forget`: delete by URI, or search first and remove a single strong match
- `ov_archive_expand`: expand a concrete archive back into raw messages

They serve different roles:

- automatic recall covers the default case where the model does not know what to search yet
- `memory_recall` gives the model an explicit follow-up search path
- `memory_store` is for immediately persisting clearly important information
- `ov_archive_expand` is the “go back to archive detail” escape hatch when summaries are not enough

`ov_archive_expand` is especially important because `assemble()` normally returns archive summaries and indexes, not the full raw transcript.

## Local / Remote Runtime Modes

![Runtime modes and routing behavior](./images/openclaw-plugin-runtime-routing.png)

The current implementation supports two runtime modes. The upper-layer session, memory, and archive model stays the same in both.

### Local mode

In `local` mode, the plugin manages the OpenViking subprocess itself:

- resolve Python from `OPENVIKING_PYTHON`, env files, or system defaults
- prepare the port before startup
- kill stale OpenViking processes on the target port
- move to the next free port if another process owns the configured one
- wait for `/health` before marking the service ready
- cache the local client so multiple plugin registrations do not spawn duplicates

That is why this plugin is not only “memory logic”. It is also a local runtime manager.

### Remote mode

In `remote` mode, the plugin behaves as a pure HTTP client:

- no local subprocess is started
- `baseUrl` and optional `apiKey` come from plugin config
- session context, memory find/read, commit, and archive expansion behavior stays the same

The main difference between `local` and `remote` is who is responsible for bringing up the OpenViking service, not the higher-level context model.

## Relationship to the Older Design Draft

The repo also contains a more future-looking design draft at `docs/design/openclaw-context-engine-refactor.md`. It is important not to conflate the two:

- this README describes current implemented behavior
- the older draft discusses a stronger future move into context-engine-owned lifecycle control
- in the current version, the main automatic recall path still lives in `before_prompt_build`, not fully in `assemble()`
- in the current version, `afterTurn()` already appends to the OpenViking session, but commit remains threshold-triggered and asynchronous on that path
- in the current version, `compact()` already uses `commit(wait=true)`, but it is still focused on synchronous commit plus readback rather than owning every orchestration concern

That distinction matters, otherwise the future design draft is easy to misread as already shipped behavior.

## Operator and Debugging Surfaces

If you need to debug this plugin, start with these entry points.

### Inspect the current setup

```bash
ov-install --current-version
openclaw config get plugins.entries.openviking.config
openclaw config get plugins.slots.contextEngine
```

### Watch logs

OpenClaw plugin logs:

```bash
openclaw logs --follow
```

OpenViking service logs:

```bash
cat ~/.openviking/data/log/openviking.log
```

### Web Console

```bash
python -m openviking.console.bootstrap --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8020 --openviking-url http://127.0.0.1:1933
```

### `ov tui`

```bash
ov tui
```

### Common things to check

| Symptom | More likely cause | First check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plugins.slots.contextEngine` is not `openviking` | The plugin slot was never set, or another plugin replaced it | `openclaw config get plugins.slots.contextEngine` |
| `local` mode fails to start | Python path, env file, or `ov.conf` is wrong | `source ~/.openclaw/openviking.env && openclaw gateway restart` |
| recall behaves inconsistently across sessions | Routing identity is not what you expected | Enable `logFindRequests`, then inspect `openclaw logs --follow` |
| long chats stop extracting memory | `pending_tokens` never crosses the threshold, or Phase 2 fails server-side | Check plugin config and `~/.openviking/data/log/openviking.log` |
| summaries are too coarse for detailed questions | You need archive-level detail, not just summary | Use an ID from `[Archive Index]` with `ov_archive_expand` |
